# Fourier-Optics
Matlab code for creating the multiple circular spots in the 2D plane 

Run either Interact_Multiple_plot or Multiple_plot, circ.m should be in the same folder

#### 1. Interact_Multiple_plot.m: It creates an array of circular spots of a given pixel size.
#### 2. LG_beam.m: This code generates a LG beam
#### 3. Multiple_plot.m: This code draws a 2D lattice array
#### 4. circ.m: This code generates a single circle in x-y plane
