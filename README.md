# Fourier-Optics
Matlab code for creating the multiple circular spots in the 2D plane 

Run either Interact_Multiple_plot or Multiple_plot [circ.m should be in the same folder]

- `Interact_Multiple_plot.m`: It creates an array of circular spots of a given pixel size.
- `LG_beam.m`: This code generates an LG beam
- `Multiple_plot.m`: This code draws a 2D lattice array
- `circ.m`: This code generates a single circle in the x-y plane
